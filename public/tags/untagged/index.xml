      <description>I once was known as a messenger
But that was long ago
When the rain was clean and the sky was dark at night
Stars shown bright
My home is so far away
My body, once strong
Flew to places that only Gods could dream
It&amp;rsquo;s husk fell, faded like a memory
Earth holds well, all the rest of me
Whatever that may be</description>

      <description>You woke me up again and youâ€™re not here
I held your kiss on my cheek
Then you said I had to go
And it all faded to the sound of rain
My window sill is wet
A pattering to the cadence of my heart
Eyes opening to soft light
And again this is all I remember
I feel a glow through my chest
An inkling of a love
Only in dreams</description>
