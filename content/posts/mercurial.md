I once was known as a messenger

But that was long ago

When the rain was clean and the sky was dark at night

Stars shown bright

My home is so far away

My body, once strong

Flew to places that only Gods could dream

It's husk fell, faded like a memory

Earth holds well, all the rest of me

Whatever that may be
