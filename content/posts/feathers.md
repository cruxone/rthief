There is a pair of wings glued to your back it seems

Because when I am with you, I am sheltered from the wind and cold

These cliffs and passes are less frightening

The loneliness less biting

I have hope and confidence

Because you are here

There is starlight in the night sky

A tended fire in my heart

Because of you and the time weâ€™ve shared
