You woke me up again and youâ€™re not here

I held your kiss on my cheek

Then you said I had to go

And it all faded to the sound of rain

My window sill is wet

A pattering to the cadence of my heart

Eyes opening to soft light

And again this is all I remember

I feel a glow through my chest

An inkling of a love

Only in dreams

I hold my cheek subconsciously
